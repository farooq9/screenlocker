# screenlocker
A screen locker ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that infects a computer system and restricts the user's access to their device by locking the screen. Once the ransomware is activated, it typically displays a full-screen message or image that informs the user that their computer has been locked.

The message displayed by the ransomware typically includes instructions on how to pay a ransom to the attacker in order to regain access to the computer. The ransom is usually demanded in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, which makes it difficult to trace the payment back to the attacker and get the key.
